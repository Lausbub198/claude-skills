# spec2opsx

A Claude Code skill that converts a specification document into a set of [OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec) (opsx) changes — each with a full artifact set and immediately testable end-to-end.

> **v1.2.0** — Added Steps 5 & 6: automatic consistency audit (architect subagent) and cascade fix with enforced spec→design→tasks propagation after all artifacts are created.

---

## What it does

You write (or already have) a product specification. You run `/spec2opsx your-spec.md`. The skill:

1. **Runs preflights** — verifies the spec file exists, checks for multi-repo scenarios, confirms the `openspec` CLI is installed, and initializes OpenSpec if needed
2. **Detects the tech stack** mentioned in the spec and recommends relevant Claude Code skills
3. **Slices the spec into vertical changes** — each one bundles backend + frontend so the feature is runnable and testable immediately after implementation
4. **Creates all four OpenSpec artifacts** per change: `proposal.md`, `specs/`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`
5. **Embeds skill references** in the artifacts so `/opsx:apply` automatically uses best-practice skills during implementation (optional, your choice)
6. **Runs a consistency audit** — spawns an architect subagent to check all artifacts for internal, cross-change, and spec-conformance issues; reports findings as CRITICAL / WARN / MINOR
7. **Fixes all CRITICAL and WARN findings** — applies fixes via `/opsx:continue` with enforced spec→design→tasks cascade, then re-audits to confirm clean

---

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) | The CLI where this skill runs |
| [OpenSpec CLI](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec) | `npm install -g openspec` |
| OpenSpec expanded profile | Enables `/opsx:new`, `/opsx:ff`, `/opsx:continue` — run `openspec config profile` to activate |

---

## Installation

Copy the skill directory into your Claude Code skills folder:

```bash
cp -r spec2opsx ~/.claude/skills/
```

Claude Code picks it up automatically on the next session.

---

## Usage

```bash
/spec2opsx path/to/your-spec.md
```

### Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--fast` | Skip the breakdown confirmation step and create all artifacts without pausing between them |
| `--tools <list>` | AI tools to configure during `openspec init` — skips the interactive prompt |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Interactive mode — review and approve each step
/spec2opsx docs/feature-spec.md

# Fast mode — create everything without pausing
/spec2opsx docs/feature-spec.md --fast

# Pre-configure tools for a specific IDE
/spec2opsx docs/feature-spec.md --tools cursor
/spec2opsx docs/feature-spec.md --tools claude,cursor --fast
```

**Supported `--tools` values:** `amazon-q`, `bob`, `claude`, `cline`, `codex`, `cursor`, `factory`, `gemini`, `github-copilot`, `windsurf`, `roocode`, `trae`, and others. Use `all` or `none` as shortcuts.

---

## How it works

### Step 0 — Preflights

Before doing anything, the skill runs four checks in order:

1. **Spec file exists** — if the path is wrong, stops with a clear error message
2. **Multi-repo check** — if the spec describes multiple services, asks which project root to use *before* running `openspec init`
3. **OpenSpec CLI installed** — checks `which openspec`; if missing, stops and prints the install command
4. **Project init** — checks if OpenSpec is already initialized; if not, runs `openspec init --tools <value>` non-interactively

Your global OpenSpec profile is never touched.

### Step 0e — Tech stack detection and skill recommendations

The skill scans the spec for technology signals and maps them to Claude Code skills. Covered stacks include:

| Tech | Skills |
|------|--------|
| Node.js, Express, Fastify, Hono | `backend-patterns` |
| React, Next.js, Vite, Remix | `react-best-practices`, `frontend-patterns` |
| TypeScript | `coding-standards` |
| Python, FastAPI, Flask | `python-patterns` |
| Django | `django-patterns` |
| Go / Golang | `golang-patterns` |
| Kotlin, Spring Boot | `kotlin-patterns`, `springboot-patterns` |
| REST API, HTTP endpoints | `api-design` |
| Tests, Jest, Vitest, pytest | `tdd-workflow` |
| E2E, Playwright, Cypress | `e2e-testing` |
| Auth, JWT, OAuth, sessions | `security-review` |
| WebSocket, SSE, real-time | `backend-patterns` |
| Tailwind, CSS, animations | `frontend-patterns` |
| PostgreSQL, MySQL, Prisma, Drizzle | `backend-patterns` |
| **Vanilla JS, single-file HTML** | `coding-standards`, `frontend-patterns` |
| **IndexedDB, localStorage** | `coding-standards` |
| **BroadcastChannel, inter-window sync** | `backend-patterns` |
| **Custom parsers, custom syntax** | `coding-standards` |
| ZIP, JSZip, file export/import | `coding-standards` |

Since Claude Code skills are only visible when loaded into the active session, the skill asks you directly which ones you have installed rather than trying to detect them automatically:

```
Detected tech stack: Vanilla JS, BroadcastChannel, IndexedDB, Web Audio API

Recommended skills:
  coding-standards
  frontend-patterns
  backend-patterns

Which of these do you have installed?
(Type the names, "all", "none", or "unknown")
```

Then it asks how you want skill references handled in the generated artifacts:

```
Embed skill references in generated artifacts (design.md / tasks.md)?
  [A] Yes, all recommended skills (including not-yet-installed)
  [B] Yes, available skills only
  [C] Skip — no skill references in artifacts
```

Choosing **A** or **B** means `design.md` gets a `## Required Skills` section and `tasks.md` gets inline hints like `→ /react-best-practices` on relevant tasks. When you later run `/opsx:apply`, Claude picks up these references automatically. Choosing **C** generates clean artifacts with no skill annotations.

### Step 1 — Vertical slice analysis

The spec is split into **vertical slices** — not layers. Each change bundles the backend logic, API endpoint(s), and frontend UI for one feature so it's runnable end-to-end immediately after implementation.

**The rule:** one change = one "I can demo this right now" moment.

The first change is always a thin **foundation** (server + connection + frontend shell) — just enough to get a blank screen running. Everything else is feature slices in dependency order.

### Step 2 — Breakdown proposal (interactive mode)

Before creating anything, the skill presents its proposed breakdown:

```
Proposed breakdown: 6 changes

1. foundation
   What: Express server, WebSocket setup, blank React shell, design tokens
   Why separate: required skeleton for all subsequent slices

2. file-tracking
   What: File watcher backend + FileTree widget
   Why separate: independent feature, immediately testable (save a file, see it appear)
...

Proceed? (or describe adjustments)
```

You can adjust names, merge changes, or reorder before anything is created. In `--fast` mode this step is skipped.

### Step 3 — Artifact creation

For each change, the skill emits a status line (`── Change N/X: <name> ──`) then creates:

| Artifact | Contents |
|----------|----------|
| `proposal.md` | Problem, scope, success criteria |
| `specs/` | Functional requirements, data structures, API contracts, edge cases |
| `design.md` | Tech choices, architecture decisions, open questions flagged with `⚠ Decision needed:` |
| `tasks.md` | Checkable tasks ordered infrastructure → data → logic → UI → tests |

**Interactive mode** pauses after each artifact so you can review it. The pause after `design.md` is intentional — that's the cheapest moment to change tech choices or architecture before tasks are generated.

**Fast mode** (`--fast`) creates all four artifacts per change without pausing, using `/opsx:ff` in one step.

### Step 4 — Summary

```
✓ spec2opsx complete

Created: 6 changes
  1. foundation         — proposal ✓  specs ✓  design ✓  tasks ✓
  2. file-tracking      — proposal ✓  specs ✓  design ✓  tasks ✓
  ...

Next step: /opsx:apply foundation to start implementation
Recommended order: foundation → file-tracking → git-tracking → ...
```

### Step 5 — Consistency Audit

After all changes are created, an `architect` subagent reads every artifact and the original spec to audit three dimensions:

| Dimension | What it checks |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Internal consistency per change** | `proposal.md` ↔ `specs/` ↔ `design.md` ↔ `tasks.md` agree on interfaces, filenames, event names, and numeric thresholds |
| **Cross-change consistency** | Shared types are referenced correctly by all consumers; file paths and module names are stable; inter-module contracts match on both sides |
| **Spec conformance** | Every acceptance criterion appears in at least one `tasks.md`; all RISKs are addressed; no thresholds have drifted |

Findings are reported as `CRITICAL` / `WARN` / `MINOR` with change name, file, line, and description. The audit runs in both interactive and `--fast` mode — it is never skipped.

### Step 6 — Cascade Fix

Every CRITICAL and WARN finding from Step 5 is fixed via `/opsx:continue` (or `/opsx:ff` in fast mode), enforcing the **spec→design→tasks cascade**:

1. Fix the **spec file** first — it is the source of truth
2. If an architecture decision changed → update **design.md** in the same pass
3. If implementation steps changed → update **tasks.md** in the same pass

All three edits are atomic — a spec fix is never committed without its downstream cascade. MINOR findings are applied only when trivially safe. After all fixes, Step 5 re-runs to confirm clean. The final audit result is appended to the Step 4 summary:

```
Audit:    6 CRITICAL · 24 WARN · 22 MINOR found
Fixed:    all CRITICAL and WARN; 4 MINOR skipped (ambiguous)
Re-audit: ✓ 0 CRITICAL · 0 WARN · 4 MINOR remaining
```

## Interactive vs fast mode

| | Interactive | Fast (`--fast`) |
|-|-------------|-----------------|
| Breakdown proposal | shown, waits for approval | shown briefly, auto-proceeds |
| Artifact creation | pauses after each artifact | all 4 created in one step (`/opsx:ff`) |
| Architecture checkpoint | yes — explicit pause at `design.md` | no |
| Consistency audit (Step 5) | always runs | always runs |
| Cascade fix (Step 6) | `/opsx:continue` per finding | `/opsx:ff` per finding |
| Best for | first pass on a new spec, or when you want to influence design | already familiar with the spec, want artifacts quickly |

## Skill references in artifacts

When you choose mode **A** or **B**, the generated `design.md` includes a section like:

```markdown
## Required Skills
Use these skills when implementing this change with /opsx:apply:
- /react-best-practices — for all React components
- /backend-patterns — for Express routes and middleware
- /tdd-workflow — before writing any implementation code
```

And `tasks.md` includes inline hints:

```markdown
- [ ] Implement FileTree component → /react-best-practices
- [ ] Set up Express routes → /backend-patterns
- [ ] Write unit tests → /tdd-workflow
```

These hints are added only where a skill makes a meaningful difference — not on every task.

Skills are sourced from the [everything-claude-code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-skills) collection. Installation: copy the skill directory into `~/.claude/skills/`.

---

## Recovery from interrupted runs

If you cancel after the breakdown is approved but before all changes are created:

**Option A — resume manually:**
1. Run `/opsx:new <next-change-name>` for each remaining change
2. Follow the Step 3 artifact sequence per change

**Option B — restart cleanly:**
1. Delete the `openspec/` directory
2. Re-run `/spec2opsx <spec-path>` from the beginning

To skip already-created changes: tell Claude `"Changes 1–N are done, continue from change N+1."` The skill will skip init and jump straight to the remaining slices.
